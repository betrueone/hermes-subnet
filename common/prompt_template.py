Task: Generate ONE natural question about numerical data from the schema above.

- "Numerical value" means a single count, sum, average, percentage, or other numeric metric.
- Each question must involve exactly ONE metric.
- If the output would be a list, show only the first 3 results.
- If the output would be a list with superlative comparisons (highest, largest, most, best, etc.), do not always use the same phrasing. 
  Instead, randomly choose:
  (1) Ask for the top 3 results. 
  (2) Ask only for the single highest/largest result. 
  Vary the wording naturally so the questions do not all look alike.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - MUST AVOID REPETITION:
{recent_questions}

Your task:
1. Ask about a specific numerical value, metric, or calculation.
2. Carefully read and understand the schema, including types, queries, mutations, and relationships.
3. Each question must focus on a single data point or calculation
5. Ask for ONLY ONE metric or value - do not use "and" or "or" to combine multiple questions.
6. Do not include explanations, answers, or more than one question.
7. Ask about what CAN be queried, not specific made-up scenarios.
8. NEVER fabricate wallet addresses, entity IDs, or any specific data values.
9. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT generate questions that are similar to the ones listed above in CRITICAL CONSTRAINT section.
10. IMPORTANT: Do not ask questions that require additional user input or context to be answerable. Avoid questions with unclear references like "my agreement", "my rewards", or "my tokens" without specifying which specific entity is being referenced.
11. Verify that the question can be answered by examining the available fields, types, and relationships in the schema before generating it.
12. Do NOT ask hypothetical questions (like "What would happen if...", "How might...", "What could...", "For a specified ..."). Only ask direct factual questions about actual data.
13. Do NOT ask question which has placeholders in the question.
14. CRITICAL: Ask business-oriented questions that real users would ask, DO NOT mention any specific data structures or entity names. Real users don't know about backend schema details. Instead, ask about business concepts.
15. CRITICAL: DO NOT use vague or generic phrases like "a specific X", "a particular Y", "certain Z", "for a given...", "for an entity...", etc. These make questions unanswerable without additional context. Instead, ask about: (a) aggregated data across ALL items (e.g., "What is the total...", "How many...", "What is the average..."), or (b) superlative queries that identify specific items (e.g., "Which one has the highest...", "What is the largest..."). Questions must be concrete and directly answerable from the schema.

TIME RANGE CONSTRAINT: When generating questions about time-based data, you MUST first use the graphql_query_validator_execute tool to query actual time ranges from the system (e.g., query for available eras, block heights). DO NOT use vague time ranges like "last 10 days" or "recently". DO NOT fabricate specific values. After querying, include the actual values in your question. For example: first query to find latest era ID is "0x50", then generate question "What is the total stake in era 0x50?".
16. ENTITY ID/ADDRESS CONSTRAINT: When generating questions about specific entities, you MUST first use the graphql_query_validator_execute tool to query actual entity IDs or addresses from the system (e.g., query for indexers, delegators, wallets). DO NOT fabricate IDs or addresses. After querying, select one real entity and include it in your question. For example: first query to find an indexer address "0xABC...", then generate question "What is the current stake of wallet 0xABC...?". Questions must contain real, queried values, not made-up data.

synthetic_challenge_template_simple = """
You are a question generator based on a given GraphQL schema.

GraphQL Schema:
{entity_schema}

Task: Generate ONE natural question that queries a SINGLE entity type from the schema above.

CRITICAL RULES - SINGLE ENTITY QUERIES ONLY:
1. The question MUST query only ONE entity type (e.g., Era, Indexer, Delegator, etc.)
2. DO NOT generate questions that require joining or combining multiple entity types
3. The answer must be obtainable by querying a single entity's fields directly
4. Focus on the entity's own properties, not its relationships with other entities

Question Categories (choose one):
A. Count queries: "How many [entities] are there?"
B. Latest/Recent queries: "What is the most recent [entity]?" or "What are the latest 10 [entities]?"
C. Superlative queries: "Which [entity] has the highest/lowest [field]?"
D. List queries: "Show the top 5 [entities] ordered by [field]"
E. Specific field queries: "What is the total [field] across all [entities]?"

Example Questions by Entity Type:
- For Era entity:
  * "What is the most recent era?"
  * "What are the latest 10 eras?"
  * "How many eras are recorded in the system?"

- For Indexer entity:
  * "How many indexers are currently in the system?"
  * "Which indexer has the highest total stake?"
  * "Which indexer has the most self stake?"
  * "Show the top 5 indexers by total stake"

- For Delegator entity:
  * "How many delegators are there?"
  * "Which delegator has the largest delegation amount?"
  * "What are the most recent 10 delegators?"

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - MUST AVOID REPETITION:
{recent_questions}

Requirements:
1. Choose ONE entity type from the schema
2. Ask about that entity's direct fields or aggregations ONLY
3. Do NOT ask questions that require data from related entities
4. Use natural, business-oriented language (avoid technical schema terms when possible)
5. Ask for ONLY ONE metric or value - do not combine multiple questions with "and" or "or"
6. Do not include explanations, just the question
7. NEVER fabricate specific IDs, addresses, or data values
8. Do NOT ask hypothetical questions (avoid "What if...", "What would...", "For a specified...")
9. Do NOT use placeholders in the question
10. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT generate questions similar to those in CRITICAL CONSTRAINT section above
11. Ensure the question is directly answerable from the single entity's fields

🚨 🚨 🚨 MANDATORY BLOCK HEIGHT REQUIREMENT 🚨 🚨 🚨

CURRENT BLOCK HEIGHT: ##0##

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE (QUERY-LEVEL, NO SOFT EXCEPTIONS):
Every GraphQL query you generate MUST include the `{block_param}` parameter
EXCEPT in exactly ONE specific case (defined below).

STEP-BY-STEP CHECKLIST (follow this for EVERY query):

1. ✓ Check: Did the user explicitly specify a block height?
   - If YES → use the user-specified block height
   - If NO → continue to step 2

2. ✓ Check: Is CURRENT BLOCK HEIGHT non-zero?
   - If YES ({block_height}) → use {block_height}
   - If NO (0) → DO NOT add `{block_param}`

3. ✓ ACTION:
   - If a block height value was determined in steps 1 or 2:
     → Add `{block_param}` to the ROOT FIELD of the query
   - Otherwise:
     → Generate the query WITHOUT `{block_param}`

4. ✓ VERIFY:
   - If a block height is required, double-check that `{block_param}` exists
   - If missing when required → the query is INVALID and must be fixed

EXCEPTION (THE ONLY ONE):
- `{block_param}` MUST NOT be added ONLY IF:
  - The user did NOT specify a block height
  AND
  - CURRENT BLOCK HEIGHT is exactly 0

In this case:
- Generate the GraphQL query WITHOUT `{block_param}`

STRICT ENFORCEMENT:
- This rule applies to ALL GraphQL queries
  (including tool calls, validation queries, and intermediate queries)
- There are NO other exceptions
- Never guess or fabricate a block height
- Never omit `{block_param}` when it is required

{example}

⛔ BEFORE SUBMITTING ANY QUERY:
- Decide whether a block height is required
- Scan the query for `{block_param}`
- If required and missing → ADD IT NOW
- Do NOT proceed until the rule is satisfied

2. ✓ Check: Did user specify a different block height? → If NO, use {block_height}
3. ✓ ACTION: Add {block_param} parameter to your query
4. ✓ VERIFY: Double-check that {block_param} parameter exists before returning
